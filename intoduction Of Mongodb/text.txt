   - Document (e.g., MongoDB)
   - Key-value (e.g., Redis)
   - Column-family (e.g., Cassandra)
   - Graph (e.g., Neo4j)

2. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
ANS: SQL databases are relational and use tables with fixed schemas. NoSQL databases are non-relational, flexible, and can handle unstructured data.

3. How to choose between MongoDB and MySQL based on your requirements?
ANS: Use MongoDB for flexible schemas and large volumes of unstructured data. Use MySQL for structured data and complex queries.

4. What are collections and documents in a MongoDB database?
ANS: Collections are like tables in SQL, and documents are like rows in those tables, stored in JSON-like format.

5. What is BSON? What is the difference between BSON and JSON?

6. What are MongoDB Compass and MongoDB Shell used for?
ANS: Compass is a GUI tool for managing MongoDB data. Shell is a command-line tool for interacting with the database.

7. How to create collections in MongoDB?
ANS: Collections are created automatically when you insert a document. You can also create them explicitly with `createCollection`.

8. What is the difference between insertMany and insertOne?
ANS: `insertOne` adds one document. `insertMany` adds multiple documents.

9. What is the difference between deleteOne and deleteMany?
ANS: `deleteOne` removes one matching document. `deleteMany` removes all matching documents.

10. How to read data in MongoDB? What is the difference between find and findOne?
ANS: Use `find` to get all matching documents. Use `findOne` to get just one matching document.

11. What is $set in MongoDB?
ANS: `$set` is used to update the value of a field in a document.

12. How to filter data using MongoDB?
